Description: This package presents a range of simulations to aid researchers in determining appropriate sample sizes when performing critical
    thermal limits studies (e.g. CTmin/CTmin experiments). A number of wrapper functions are provided for plotting and summarising outputs
    from these simulations. These simulations are presented in Owen et al. (unpublished). Sample size determinination for critical thermal
    limits studies. doi: [add here].

# ThermalSampleR

This repo contains the source code and skeleton R code for a package I am currently developing to calculate sample sizes required for accurate and precise estimates of critical thermal limits (e.g. CTmin/CTmax) for biological organisms. `ThermalSampleR` is still under development. Any input or advice would be much appreciated.

# `ThermalSampleR` package

This repo contains the source code and skeleton R code for a package I am currently developing to calculate sample sizes required for accurate and precise estimates of critical thermal limits (e.g. CTmin/CTmax) for biological organisms. 

The core functionality of `ThermalSampleR` revolves around:
- 1. Bootstrap resampling of raw data 
- 2. Calculate population parameter of interest (e.g. mean) and confidence intervals across bootstrap samples.
- 3. Calculate distribution of population parameter of interest. 
- 4. Wrapper functions to assist in plotting and making inferences from these simulations. 

`ThermalSampleR` is still under development. This is my first attempt at writing an `R` package, so any input or advice would be much appreciated, particularly with regards to package development.
